# Cpp STL-crash-course

This course is designed to be slow-paced, simple and rich in demystifying the question: What really is an STL? These few lectures serve as a crucial foundation for Data structures and Algorithms (DSA). 

STL- Standard Template Library is a must, if you want to start Data Structures and Algorithms.

In this course, we will cover everything regarding STL, which includes : Containers, Iterators, Algorithms.It includes simple,  adapter and associative containers. We will learn detailed implementation of inbuilt templates. 

Topics like Vector, Set, Map, Stack, Queue, Doubly Ended Queue, List  are covered with its implementation.

This course will have quiz sections after each concept. There will be resource files attached after each section.

If you know basic C++ and want to master DSA. This course will surely help you.

We will also have a Q and A sections where you can ask your doubts and I will be answering them. If I found something should is missed, I'll update the course frequently and you will be updated accordingly.

If you want to start DSA but confused with direction.

By the end of this course you'll know the core concepts of STL. You can start your DSA concepts 

You will master:

Container and its types with proper implementation.

Basics of  Algorithms

Hope you learn and enjoy!!!
